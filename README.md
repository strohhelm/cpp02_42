# C++ Project 02 - Canonical Form | Polymorphism | Operator Overload 

###  General Rules for these projects: 
The purpose of these c++ projects is to get introduced into OOP. We are allowed to use standard c++17. 

- code must be coiled with `c++` and the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra`.
- there must be a Makefile for each exercise.
- Class names and corresponding filenames must be written in UpperCamelCase format.
- The `using namespace <ns_name>` and `friend` keywords are forbidden.
- There must be no memory leaks.
- Classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form.
- There can be no function implementations in headerfiles.
- Headers must be able to be used independently from others.
- Use of STL in the Module 08 and 09 only->no containers / Algorithm header


## ðŸ”¶ ex00 My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
### Objective: You are going to discover a new and awesome number type: fixed-point numbers! As C++ lacks fixed-point numbers, youâ€™re going to add them.


### Usage:
  ```
  cd ex00
  make
  ./main
```


### My thoughts: 
- Interesting learning about the difficulty in Computer Sience to calculate and store floating-point numbers.


## ðŸ”¶ ex01 Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
### Ojective: adding multiple constructors with different argument types to the fixed-point class.
### Usage:
  ```
  cd ex01
  make
  ./main
```

### My thoughts:
- First Contact with the function overloading possibilities in c++ and operator overloading possibilities. Very smart.

## ðŸ”¶ ex02 Now weâ€™re talking
### Ojective:add operator overloads for `>  <    >=  <=  ==  !=  +  -  *  /  ` as well as pre- and post de- and increment operators
### Usage:
  ```
  cd ex02
  make
  ./main
```

### My thoughts:
- Many small functions but interesting to see the overloading syntax.
